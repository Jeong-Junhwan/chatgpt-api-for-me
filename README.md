cd chatgpt-api-for-me
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Before running the script, make sure you have an OpenAI API key. Save the API key in a file called `api_key.txt` in the project directory.

To run the `main.py` script, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to select the desired functionality (currently only supports Python prompt generation) and enter your query. The script will then use the ChatGPT API to generate a response based on your input.
